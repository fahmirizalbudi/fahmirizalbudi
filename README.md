<h2>Hello!</h2>

I am a Software Engineering student from [Republic of Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia). I build web and mobile applications with a strong focus on usability, performance, and real-world problem solving. My passion lies in turning ideas into reliable digital products, bridging the gap between academic theory and practical implementation.

I’m always open to collaboration, freelance opportunities, and meaningful discussions. You can find and reach me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/fahmirizalbudi), connect with me on [Email](fahmirizal.dev@gmail.com).
